# craiglistwebscraper

This is a simple webscraper used for craiglists posts. Inspiration for this project came from searching for new bikes to buy in and around New York City. Much of the source code had been taken from a much more comprehensive program that can be found at https://towardsdatascience.com/web-scraping-craigslist-a-complete-tutorial-c41cea4f4981

Main changes that I had made include deleting any visualisations as this was not important for my project, also removing code that would avoid errors and gaps in data if it was not present on the page. 

This was my first attempt at a web scraper - any suggestions, constructive feedback is much appreciated. Please email jordan.creenaune@gmail.com
